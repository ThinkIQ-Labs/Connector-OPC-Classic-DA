# Connector-OPC-Classic-DA
Contains the latest release of the OPC DA Connector. This repository was created in response to CESMII AND THINKIQ CORE PLATFORM LICENSE AGREEMENT

### Notice
These packages contain DLL's for more than just the OPC DA Connector. When a connector establishes communication with a Platform instance it is informed what its connector type is based on how it was modeled. The connector will be linked to a node in the model based off its activation code.
